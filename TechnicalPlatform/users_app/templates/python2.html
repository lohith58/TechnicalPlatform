   <h3 class="font1 text-left underline">Pyhton Applications :</h3>
   <p class="font1">Python is known for its general-purpose nature that makes it applicable in almost every domain of software development. Python makes its presence in every emerging field. It is the fastest-growing programming language and can develop any application.</p>
   <p class="font1">Here, we are specifying application areas where Python can be applied.</p>
 <img class="text-center" src="{%static 'images/python-applications.png'%}" alt="python application">
 <h3 class="font1 underline">Web Applications :</h3>
    <p class="font1">We can use Python to develop web applications. It provides libraries to handle internet protocols such as HTML and XML, JSON, Email processing, request, beautifulSoup, Feedparser, etc. One of Python web-framework named Django is used on Instagram. Python provides many useful frameworks, and these are given below:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Django and Pyramid framework(Use for heavy applications)</li>
      <li>Flask and Bottle (Micro-framework)</li>
      <li>Plone and Django CMS (Advance Content management)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="font1 underline">Desktop GUI Applications :</h3>
    <p class="font1">The GUI stands for the Graphical User Interface, which provides a smooth interaction to any application. Python provides a Tk GUI library to develop a user interface. Some popular GUI libraries are given below.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Tkinter or Tk</li>
      <li>wxWidgetM</li>
      <li>Kivy (used for writing multitouch applications )</li>
      <li>PyQt or Pyside</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="font1 underline">Console Based Applications :</h3>
    <p class="font1">Console-based applications run from the command-line or shell. These applications are computer program which are used commands to execute. This kind of application was more popular in the old generation of computers. Python can develop this kind of application very effectively. It is famous for having REPL, which means the Read-Eval-Print Loop that makes it the most suitable language for the command-line applications.</p>
    <p class="font1">Python provides many free library or module which helps to build the command-line apps. The necessary IO libraries are used to read and write. It helps to parse argument and create console help text out-of-the-box. There are also advance libraries that can develop independent console apps.</p>
    <h3 class="font1 underline">Scientific and Numeric :</h3>
    <p class="font1">This is the era of Artificial intelligence where the machine can perform the task the same as the human. Python language is the most suitable language for Artificial intelligence or machine learning. It consists of many scientific and mathematical libraries, which makes easy to solve complex calculations.</p>
     <p class="font1">Implementing machine learning algorithms require complex mathematical calculation. Python has many libraries for scientific and numeric such as Numpy, Pandas, Scipy, Scikit-learn, etc. If you have some basic knowledge of Python, you need to import libraries on the top of the code. Few popular frameworks of machine libraries are given below.</p>
     <ul>
       <li>SciPy</li>
       <li>Scikit-learn</li>
       <li>NumPy</li>
       <li>Pandas</li>
       <li>Matplotlib</li>
     </ul>
     <h3 class="font1 underline">Business Applications :</h3>
     <p class="font1">Business Applications differ from standard applications. E-commerce and ERP are an example of a business application. This kind of application requires extensively, scalability and readability, and Python provides all these features.</p>
     <p class="font1">Oddo is an example of the all-in-one Python-based application which offers a range of business applications. Python provides a Tryton platform which is used to develop the business application.</p>
