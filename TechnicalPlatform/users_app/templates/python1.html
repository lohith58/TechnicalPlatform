   <h3 class="font1 text-left underline">Pyhon Tutorial</h3>
   <p class="font1">Python tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts of Python. Our Python tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals.</p>
  <p class="font1">Python is a simple, general purpose, high level, and object-oriented programming language.</p>
  <p class="font1">Python is an interpreted scripting language also. Guido Van Rossum is known as the founder of Python programming.</p>
   <p class="font1">Our Python tutorial includes all topics of Python Programming such as installation, control statements, Strings, Lists, Tuples, Dictionary, Modules, Exceptions, Date and Time, File I/O, Programs, etc. There are also given Python interview questions to help you better understand Python Programming.</p>
   <h3 class="font1 text-left underline">What is Python ?</h3>
   <p class="font1"><strong>python</strong> is a general purpose, dynamic, high-level, and interpreted programming language. It supports Object Oriented programming approach to develop applications. It is simple and easy to learn and provides lots of high-level data structures.</p>
   <p class="font1">Python is easy to learn yet powerful and versatile scripting language, which makes it attractive for Application Development.</p>
   <p class="font1">Python supports multiple programming pattern, including object-oriented, imperative, and functional or procedural programming styles.</p>
   <p class="font1">Python is not intended to work in a particular area, such as web programming. That is why it is known as multipurpose programming language because it can be used with web, enterprise, 3D CAD, etc.</p>
   <p class="font1">We don't need to use data types to declare variable because it is dynamically typed so we can write a=10 to assign an integer value in an integer variable.</p>
   <p class="font1">Python makes the development and debugging fast because there is no compilation step included in Python development, and edit-test-debug cycle is very fast.</p>
   <h3 class="font1 text-left underline">Python 2 vs. Python 3</h3>
   <p class="font1">In most of the programming languages, whenever a new version releases, it supports the features and syntax of the existing version of the language, therefore, it is easier for the projects to switch in the newer version. However, in the case of Python, the two versions Python 2 and Python 3 are very much different from each other.</p>
   <p class="font1">A list of differences between Python 2 and Python 3 are given below:</p>
   <ol>
     <li>Python 2 uses print as a statement and used as print "something" to print some string on the console. On the other hand, Python 3 uses print as a function and used as print("something") to print something on the console.</li>
     <li>Python 2 uses the function raw_input() to accept the user's input. It returns the string representing the value, which is typed by the user. To convert it into the integer, we need to use the int() function in Python. On the other hand, Python 3 uses input() function which automatically interpreted the type of input entered by the user. However, we can cast this value to any type by using primitive functions (int(), str(), etc.).</li>
     <li>In Python 2, the implicit string type is ASCII, whereas, in Python 3, the implicit string type is Unicode.</li>
     <li>Python 3 doesn't contain the xrange() function of Python 2. The xrange() is the variant of range() function which returns a xrange object that works similar to Java iterator. The range() returns a list for example the function range(0,3) contains 0, 1, 2.</li>
     <li>There is also a small change made in Exception handling in Python 3. It defines a keyword as which is necessary to be used. We will discuss it in Exception handling section of Python programming tutorial.</li>
   </ol>
   <h3 class="font1 text-left underline">Python Basic Syntax</h3>
   <p class="font1">There is no use of curly braces or semicolon in Python programming language. It is English-like language. But Python uses the indentation to define a block of code. Indentation is nothing but adding whitespace before the statement when it is needed.<strong>for Exapmle :</strong></p>
   <pre class="language-python">
       <code>
    def func():
       statement 1
       statement 2
       …………………
       …………………
       statement N
</code>
     </pre>
  <h3 class="font1 text-left underline">Python First Program</h3>
   <p class="font1">Unlike the other programming languages, Python provides the facility to execute the code using few lines. <strong>For example -</strong> Suppose we want to print the <strong>"Hello World"</strong> program in Java; it will take three lines to print it.</p>
   <pre class="language-java">
       <code>
public class HelloWorld {
 public static void main(String[] args){
// Prints "Hello, World" to the terminal window.
  System.out.println("Hello World");
 }
 }
</code>
     </pre>
   <p class="font1">On the other hand, we can do this using one statement in Python.</p>
   <pre class="language-python">
       <code>
 print("Hello World")
</code>
     </pre>
   <p class="font1">Both programs will print the same result, but it takes only one statement without using a semicolon or curly braces in Python.</p>
